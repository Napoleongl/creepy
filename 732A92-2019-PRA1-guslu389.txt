Horror stories tap in to one of humanities basic notions - fear. They are a traditional way of conveying warnings of dangerous areas and objects, but are also told for pure entertainment. It is therefore no wonder that tales of ghosts and monsters have found their place on the internet as creepypasta being shared from site to site. This way, the stories continue to evolve and adapt to the fears of modern humans, generating new characters and settings in conjunction with our inherited fears. This project aims at finding the common building blocks found in the creepypasta. To do this, almost 500 stories found on \href{https://www.creepypasta.se/}{creepypasta.se} are analysed using topic modelling. The resulting topics can be broadly divided into four categories of settings, characters and frightful objects. Stories that have similar distribution of topics are  discussed as are stories that appear very different from each other.
